Thank you for your thoughtful reviews. Questions are answered in the
order raised.

Reviewer 1:

    Is there a reason why you're not proving & adding to the
    rewrite machinery all the laws of the form variable vs.
    constant?

We don't need them, but we agree that it is a good idea to add them
and to add --local-confluence-check. We will update the paper.

   ## Parametric suc
   ah, I see this is mentioned in l514! It may be worth
   adding a forward pointer to it in the relevant section.

We will add a forward reference.

   ## CwF.id

We've now tried the proof without and with polymorphic id. We
still think that without is preferable, because it simplifies
some of the laws. We will add a discussion of the tradeoffs.

  ## Preorder

  It's overkill but you could define __ as the order
  induced by the definition of divisibility built from

This is a good idea, we will mention this alternative.

Thank you for pointing to the mistake with De Bruijn - we will fix all typos.

  You're now proving 6 lemmas about the interactions of V-to-T weakening
  and composition, substitution, weakening. Does this negate the claim
  that your setup leads to a lack of repetition if you've now created
  new kinds of coherence lemmas to prove?

Indeed, there is a tradeoff here. The traditional way requires many
similar but subtly different proofs, our way requires six boilerplate
lemmas.  We think it worthwhile to have in the literature a technique
that formally explicates the underlying similarities. Among other
things, doing so means someone may work out how to further simplify
the boilerplate.

   It took me some time to understand/decode the syntax in the paper.

Apologies. We will rewrite to make the paper more readable for an Agda
novice.

  I'm not keen on the fact that many of the problems encountered (and
  solved) are Agda specific.

Exactly the same issues arise in Rocq, Lean, and Idris, or a rigorous
paper proof.  We briefly discuss the situation for other proof systems
in the conclusions. We will expand the discussion, and mention
relevant points in the introduction.

  The problem in the paper, solved by V<T, just does not arise in a
  proof sketched out mathematically on paper, so-to-speak .

The problem shows up in the paper proof if you are concerned that your
proof is well-founded. The alternative is to explicitly introduce a
well-founded ordering which was done in [6] by one of the authors.
This seems like overkill, once you realize that structural recursion
does the job.

reviewer 3

   They use notation is is [sic] not explained.

Apologies. We will rewrite to make the paper more readable for an Agda
novice.

  After developing definitions of contexts, (lambda) terms,
  variables, and substitutions, the authors detail proofs that
  substitution satisfies the laws of a functor. They seem to assume
  the other properties of a category are obvious.

This is incorrect. We explicitly prove all the laws of the
category. Functoriality of substitution is only a small part of our
proof.

   The key idea seems to be to treat variables as a subsort of terms.
   Which seems to be the default in a first-order logic setting.

The implication here is incorrect. In our setting there is an
injection from variables to terms. Replacing the injection by an
embedding (i.e., making variables a subsort of terms) is a notational
change but doesn't fundamentally change the proof.

   so while the Agda-fluent readers do form an important part of the FSCD
   community, I urge the authors to include more explanations and
   intuitions for the wider audience.

Apologies. We will rewrite to make the paper more readable for an Agda
novice.

   I would have been very excited to see you taking advantage of the
   initiality result,

The real payoff is when using dependent types where using explicit
substitution laws ends up in transport hell. We will add this to the
discussion.

   I suggest citing and discussing the early Fiore-Plotkin-Turi paper
   "Abstract Syntax and Variable Binding" (LICS 1999).

Thank you - we will add the reference and discuss the relation.

   I would suggest avoiding the symbol |= for context substitution, as
   this is usually associated with semantic satisfaction. You could
   consider using ||- instead?

Good point - we will adopt the proposal.
