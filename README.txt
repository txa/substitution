This folder includes the LaTeX and literate Agda source for "Substitution
Without Copy and Paste"

The Agda source consists of the following files:
naive.lagda (section 2)
subst.lagda (section 3)
laws.lagda (section 4)
init.lagda (section 5)

Each of these files can be loaded into Agda by using emacs and then evaluating the buffer (C-c C-l). Later chapters import definitions from earlier ones.

This was tested with Agda 2.6.1 and Agda 2.7.0.1
