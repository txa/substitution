This are the agda sources for our paper Substitution without copy and paste.

They consist out of the follwoing files:
naive.lagda (section 2)
subst.lagda (section 3)
laws.lagda (section 4)
init.lagda (section5)

Each of the files can be loaded into agda by using emacs and then evaluating the buffer (C-c C-l). Later chapters import definitions from earlier ones.

This was tested with agda 2.6.1.
